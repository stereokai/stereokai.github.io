<p>You've probably heard how paramount blogging is to the success of your marketing. Without it, your SEO will tank, you'll have nothing to promote in social media, you'll have no clout with your leads and customers, and you'll have fewer pages to put those oh-so-valuable&nbsp;calls-to-action that generate inbound leads. Need I say more?</p>
<p>So why, oh why, does almost every marketer I talk to have a laundry list of excuses for why they can't consistently blog? <!--more-->Maybe because, unless you're one of the few people who actually like writing, business blogging kind of stinks. You have to find words, string them together into sentences, and ughhh where do you even start?</p>
<p><span>Well my friend, the time for excuses is over. </span></p>
<h3><a href="http://hubs.ly/H01hkR30" target="_blank">Download our free blog post templates here to learn how to write 5 different types of blog posts.</a></h3>
<p>After you read this post, there will be absolutely no reason you can't blog every single day --<span>&nbsp;and do it quickly. Not only am I about to provide you with a simple blogging formula to follow,&nbsp;but I'm also going to give you <strong><a href="http://hubs.ly/H01hlbp0" target="_blank">free templates for creating five different types of blog posts</a></strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The How-To Post</span></li>
<li><span>The List-Based Post</span></li>
<li><span>The Curated Collection Post</span></li>
<li><span>The SlideShare Presentation Post</span></li>
<li><span>The Newsjacking Post</span></li>
</ul>
<p>With all this blogging how-to, literally anyone can blog as long as they truly know the subject matter they're writing about. And since you're an expert in your industry, there's no longer any reason you can't sit down every day and hammer out an excellent blog post.</p>
<h2>How to Write a Blog Post: A Simple Formula to Follow</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Understand your audience.</h3>
<p>Before you start to write, have a clear understanding of your target audience. What do they want to know about? What will resonate with them? This is where <a href="//blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx" target="_blank">creating your buyer personas</a> comes in handy. Consider what you know about your buyer personas and their interests while you're coming up with a topic for your&nbsp;blog post.</p>
<p>For instance, if your readers are Millennials looking to start their own business, you probably don't need to provide them with&nbsp;information about getting started in social media -- most of them already have that down. You might, however, want to give them information about how to adjust their approach to social media from a more casual, personal one to a more business-savvy, networking-focused approach. That kind of tweak is what separates you from blogging about generic stuff to the stuff your audience <em>really&nbsp;</em>wants (and needs) to hear.</p>
<h3>Step 2:&nbsp;Start with a topic and working title.</h3>
<p>Before you even write anything, you need to <a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-choose-solid-topic-next-blog-post-ht" target="_blank">pick a topic</a>&nbsp;for your blog post. The topic can be pretty general to start with. For example, if you're a plumber, you might start out thinking you want to write about leaky faucets.&nbsp;<span>Then you might come up with a few different working titles -- in other words, iterations or different ways of approaching&nbsp;that topic to help you focus your writing. </span>&nbsp;For example, you might decide to narrow your topic to "Tools for Fixing Leaky Faucets" or "Common Causes of Leaky Faucets."&nbsp;A&nbsp;working title is specific and will guide your post so you can start writing.</p>
<p>Let's take a real post as an example: "<a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-choose-solid-topic-next-blog-post-ht" target="_blank">How to Choose a Solid Topic for Your Next Blog Post</a>." Appropriate, right? The topic, in this case, was probably simply "blogging." Then the working title may have been something like, "The Process for Selecting a Blog Post Topic." And the final title ended up being "How to Choose a Solid Topic for Your Next Blog Post."</p>
<p>See that evolution from topic, to working title, to final title? Even though the working title may not end up being the final title (more on that in a moment), it still provides enough information so you can focus&nbsp;your blog post on something more specific than a generic, overwhelming topic.</p>
<h3>Step 3:&nbsp;Write an intro (and make it captivating).</h3>
<p id="last">We've written more specifically about writing captivating introductions in the post, "<a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-introduction-quick-tip-ht" target="_blank">How to Write an Introduction [Quick Tip]</a>," but let's review, shall we?</p>
<p>First, grab the reader's attention. If you lose the reader in the first few paragraphs -- or even sentences -- of the introduction, they will stop reading even before&nbsp;they've&nbsp;given your post a fair shake. You can do this in a number of ways: tell a story or a joke, be empathetic, or grip the reader with an interesting fact or statistic.</p>
<p>Then describe&nbsp;the purpose of the post and explain how it will address a problem the reader may be having.&nbsp;This will give the reader a reason to keep reading and give them a connection to how it will help them improve their work/lives.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 4:&nbsp;Organize your content.</h3>
<p>Sometimes, blog posts can have an overwhelming amount of information -- for the reader <em>and&nbsp;</em>the writer. The trick is to organize the info so readers are not intimidated by the length or amount of content. The organization can take multiple forms -- sections, lists, tips, whatever's most appropriate. But it <em>must</em> be organized!</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the post, "<a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/productivity-tools-and-techniques-ht" target="_blank">Productivity Tools and Techniques to Stop Wasting Away Your Workday</a>." There is a lot of content in this post, so we broke it into four main sections using headers -- Checking Email; Blocking Distractions; Sourcing Content; and Meetings, Collaboration, and Brainstorming. The sections are then separated into sub-sections that to go into more detail and also make the content easier to read and less intimidating using sub-headers.</p>
<p>To complete this step, all you really need to do is outline your post. That way, before you start writing, you know which points you want to cover, and the best order in which to do it. To make things even easier, you can also <strong><a href="http://hubs.ly/H01hl940" target="_blank">download and use our free&nbsp;blog post&nbsp;templates</a></strong>, which are pre-organized for five of the most common blog post types. Just fill in the blanks!&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 5:&nbsp;Write!</h3>
<p>The next step -- but not the last -- is actually writing the content. We couldn't forget about that, of course.</p>
<p>Now that you have your outline/<a href="http://hubs.ly/H01hlb_0" target="_blank">template</a>, you're ready to fill in the blanks. Use your outline as a&nbsp;guide and be sure to expand on all of your points as needed. Write about what you already know, and if necessary, do additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points, <a href="//blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33098/How-Not-to-Steal-People-s-Content-on-the-Web.aspx" target="_blank">providing proper attribution</a> when incorporating external sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't worry about the length of your post. Like my high school teachers used to say, "just make it as long as it needs to be" to be high quality and helpful.</p>
<h3>Step 6:&nbsp;Edit/proofread your post, and fix your formatting.</h3>
<p>You're not quite done yet, but you're close! The editing process is an important part of blogging -- don't overlook it. Ask a grammar-conscious co-worker to&nbsp;<a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/editing-vs-copyediting-under-100" target="_blank">copyedit</a>&nbsp;and proofread your post, and consider enlisting the help of <a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-editing-checklist" target="_blank">The Ultimate Editing Checklist</a>. Then check your formatting for the following ...</p>
<h4>Featured Image&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Make sure you choose a visually appealing and relevant image for your post. As <span>social networks treat content with images more prominently, v</span>isuals are now more responsible&nbsp;than ever for the sucess of your blog content in social media. And with <a href="//offers.hubspot.com/science-of-email-marketing-2014-report" target="_blank">data showing emails with images are preferred to those without</a>, including images is also extremely important for the emails you send to your blog&nbsp;subscribers.</p>
<p>For help selecting an image for your post, read "<a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-post-image-selection-ht-list" target="_blank">How to Select the Perfect Image for Your Next Blog Post</a>" -- and pay close attention to the section about copyright law.</p>
<h4>Visual Appearance</h4>
<p>No one likes an ugly blog post. And it's not just pictures that&nbsp;make a post visually appealing -- it's the formatting and organization of the post, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a properly formatted and visually appealing blog post, you'll notice that&nbsp;headers&nbsp;and sub-headers&nbsp;are used to break up large blocks of text -- and those headers are styled consistently. Screenshots&nbsp;always have a similar, defined border so they don't appear as if they're floating in space. The style stays consistent from post to post. Maintaining&nbsp;this consistency makes your content (and your brand) look more professional, and makes it&nbsp;easier on the eyes.</p>
<h4>Topics/Tags</h4>
<p>Tags are specific, public-facing keywords that describe a post. They also allow readers to browse&nbsp;for more content in the same category on your blog. Refrain from adding a laundry list of tags to each post. Instead, put some thought into a tagging strategy. Think of tags as "topics" or "categories," and choose 10-20 tags that represent all the main topics you want to cover on your blog. Then stick to those.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 7:&nbsp;Insert a call-to-action (CTA) at the end.</h3>
<p>At the end of every blog post, you should have a CTA that indicates what you want the reader to do next -- subscribe to your blog, download an ebook, register for a webinar or event, read a related article, etc.&nbsp;Typically, you think about the CTA being beneficial for the marketer. Your visitors read your blog post, they click on the CTA, and eventually you generate a lead. But the CTA is also a valuable resource for the person reading your content&nbsp;-- use your CTAs to offer more content similar to the subject of the post they just finished reading.</p>
<p>In the blog post, "<a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-promote-slideshares-on-blog-ht" target="_blank">How to Strategically Promote SlideShare Presentations on Your Blog</a>," for instance, readers are given tactical ways to promote their SlideShare presentations on their blog. At the end of the&nbsp;post&nbsp;is a CTA referring readers to download a PowerPoint template for SlideShare presentations.</p>
<p>See how that's a win-win for everyone? Readers who want to learn more have the opportunity to do so, and the business receives a lead they can nurture ... who&nbsp;may even become a customer! Learn more about <a href="//blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34005/How-to-Pick-the-Perfect-CTA-for-Every-Blog-Post.aspx" target="_blank">how to choose the right CTA for every blog post in this article</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 8:&nbsp;Optimize for on-page SEO.</h3>
<p>After you finish writing, go back and optimize your post for search.</p>
<p>Don't obsess over how many keywords&nbsp;to include. If there are opportunities to incorporate keywords you're targeting, and it won't impact reader experience, do it. If you can make your URL shorter and more keyword-friendly, go for it. But don't cram keywords or shoot for some arbitrary keyword density -- Google's smarter than that!</p>
<p>Here's a little reminder of what you <em>can</em> and <em>should</em> look for, but if you want a really detailed explanation, I suggest you&nbsp;<a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-seo-modern-marketer-optimize-your-posts-ht" target="_blank">read this blog post</a>.</p>
<h4>Meta Description</h4>
<p>Meta descriptions are the descriptions below the post's page title on Google's search results pages. They provide searchers with a&nbsp;short summary of the post before clicking into it. They are ideally between 150-160 characters and start with a verb, such as "Learn," "Read," or "Discover." While meta descriptions no longer factor into Google's keyword ranking algorithm, they do give searchers a snapshot of what they will get by reading&nbsp;the post and can help improve your clickthrough rate from search.</p>
<h4>Page Title and Headers</h4>
<p>Most <a href="//www.hubspot.com/products/blog" target="_blank">blogging software</a> uses your post title as your page title, which is the most important on-page SEO element at your disposal. But if you've followed our formula so far, you should already have a working title that will naturally include keywords/phrases your target audience is interested in. Don't over-complicate your title by trying to fit keywords where they don't naturally belong. That said, if there are clear&nbsp;opportunities to add keywords you're targeting to your post title and headers, feel free to take them. Also, try to&nbsp;<span>keep your headlines short -- ideally, under 65 characters -- so they don't get truncated in search engine results.</span></p>
<h4>Anchor Text</h4>
<p>Anchor text is the word or words that link to another page -- either on your website or on another website. Carefully select which keywords you want to link to other pages on your site, because search engines take that into consideration when ranking your page for certain keywords.</p>
<p>It's also important to consider which pages you link to. Consider linking to pages that you want to rank well for that keyword. You could end up getting&nbsp;it to rank on Google's first page of results instead of its second page, and that ain't small potatoes.</p>
<h4>Mobile Optimization</h4>
<p>Having a website that is responsive or designed for mobile has become more and more critical. According to a report by Google, "<a href="http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2012/09/mobile-friendly-sites-turn-visitors.html" target="_blank">What Users Want Most From Mobile Sites Today</a>," <strong>74% of users say they're also more likely to return to a site in the future if it's mobile-friendly</strong>. As a result of information like this and <a href="//blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33631/The-20-Things-Users-Want-Most-From-Your-Mobile-Site-New-Google-Data.aspx" target="_blank">other similar statistics</a>, Google is now prioritizing websites that are optimized for mobile.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Step 9:&nbsp;Pick a catchy title.</h3>
<p>Last but not least, it's time to spruce up that working title of yours. Luckily, we have a <a href="//blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht" target="_blank">simple formula for writing catchy titles</a> that will grab the attention of your reader. Here's what to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with your working title.</li>
<li>As you start to edit your title, keep in mind that it's important to keep the title accurate and clear.</li>
<li>Then, work on making your title sexy -- whether it's through strong language, alliteration, or another literary tactic.</li>
<li>If you can, optimize for SEO by sneaking some keywords in there (only if it's natural, though!).</li>
<li>Finally, see if you can shorten it at all. No one likes a long, overwhelming title -- and remember, Google prefers 65 characters or fewer before it truncates it on its search engine results pages.</li>
</ol>

            <h3 class="post-date">22 Aug 2015</h3>

<p>This post is a non-exhaustive quick overview of the so-called “unidirectional data flow” architectures. Not meant to be taken as a beginner tutorial, but rather as an overview of their differences and peculiarities. At the end, I’ll introduce a new architecture which deviates significantly from the others. This post assumes client-side Web UI frameworks only.</p>

<h2 id="terminology" class="hr"><span class="hr">TERMINOLOGY</span></h2>

<p>It would be confusing to talk about these architectures without a common terminology, so let’s assume the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>User events</strong> are events coming from input devices directly manipulated by the user. Examples: mouse clicks, scrolls, keyboard presses, touches on a touchscreen, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Architectures might use the term “View” with drastically different connotations. Instead, we use “rendering” to refer to the common understanding of “View”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>User interface rendering</strong> is the graphical output on the screen, commonly expressed as HTML or some comparable high-level declarative code such as JSX.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <strong>User interface (UI) program</strong> is any program which takes user events as input and outputs rendering, as an ongoing process rather than a one-time transformation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DOM and other layers such as frameworks and libraries are assumed to exist between the user and the architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Ownership of inter-module arrow matters.</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">A--&gt;  B</code> is different than <code class="highlighter-rouge">A  --&gt;B</code>. The former is Passive programming, while the latter is Reactive programming. Read more <a href="http://cycle.js.org/observables.html#reactive-programming">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A unidirectional architecture is said to be <strong>fractal</strong> if subcomponents are structured in the same way as the whole is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fractal architectures, the whole can be naively packaged as a component to be used in some larger application.</p>

<p>In non-fractal architectures, the non-repeatable parts are said to be <strong>orchestrators</strong> over the parts that have hierarchical composition.</p>

<h2 id="flux" class="hr"><span class="hr">FLUX</span></h2>

<p>First compulsory mention goes to <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux/">Flux</a>. It cannot be said to be the absolute pioneer, but at least in terms of popularity, it is the first unidirectional architecture for many people.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stores</strong>: manage business data and state</li>
  <li><strong>View</strong>: a hierarchical composition of React components</li>
  <li><strong>Actions</strong>: events created from user events that triggered on the View</li>
  <li><strong>Dispatcher</strong>: an event bus for all actions</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/img/flux-unidir-ui-arch.jpg"><img src="/img/flux-unidir-ui-arch.jpg" alt="Flux diagram"></a></p>

<p><strong>Peculiarities:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dispatcher.</strong> Because this is an event bus, it’s a singleton. Many Flux variants remove the need for a dispatcher, and other unidirectional architectures don’t have an equivalent to the dispatcher.</p>

<p><strong>Only View has composable components.</strong> Hierarchical composition happens only among React components, not with Stores neither with Actions. A React component is a UI program, and is usually not written as a Flux architecture internally. Hence Flux is not fractal, where the orchestrators are the Dispatcher and the Stores.</p>

<p><strong>User event handlers are declared in the rendering.</strong> In other words, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">render()</code> function of React components handles both directions of interaction with the user: rendering and user event handlers (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">onClick={this.clickHandler}</code>).</p>

<h2 id="redux" class="hr"><span class="hr">REDUX</span></h2>

<p><a href="http://rackt.github.io/redux/">Redux</a> is a variation of Flux where the singleton Dispatcher was adapted to become a singleton Store. The Store is not implemented from scratch, instead, it is created by giving a reducer function to a store factory.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Singleton Store</strong>: manages state and has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">dispatch(action)</code> function</li>
  <li><strong>Provider</strong>: a subscriber to the Store which interfaces with some “View” framework like React or Angular</li>
  <li><strong>Actions</strong>: events created from user events that are created under the Provider</li>
  <li><strong>Reducers</strong>: pure functions from previous state and an action to new state</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/img/redux-unidir-ui-arch.jpg"><img src="/img/redux-unidir-ui-arch.jpg" alt="Redux diagram"></a></p>

<p><strong>Peculiarities:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Factories for stores.</strong> A Store is created using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">createStore()</code> factory function, taking a composition of reducer functions as argument. There is also a meta-factory <code class="highlighter-rouge">applyMiddleware()</code> function which takes middleware functions as arguments. Middlewares are mechanisms of overriding the <code class="highlighter-rouge">dispatch()</code> function of a store with additional chained functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Providers.</strong> Redux is unopinionated with regards to the “View” framework used to make the UI program. It can be used with React or Angular or others. In the context of this architecture, “View” is a UI program. Like Flux, Redux is not (by design) fractal and the Store is an orchestrator.</p>

<p><strong>User event handlers may or may not be declared in the rendering.</strong> It depends on the Provider at hand.</p>

<h2 id="best" class="hr"><span class="hr">BEST</span></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://blog.famous.org/introducing-the-famous-framework/">Famous Framework</a> introduced Behavior-Event-State-Tree (BEST) as a variant of MVC, where the Controller is split into two unidirectional elements: Behavior and Event.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>State</strong>: JSON-like declaration of initial state</li>
  <li><strong>Tree</strong>: a declarative hierarchical composition of components</li>
  <li><strong>Event</strong>: event listeners (on tree) that mutate state</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior</strong>: dynamic properties (of tree) dependent on the state</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/img/best-unidir-ui-arch.jpg"><img src="/img/best-unidir-ui-arch.jpg" alt="BEST diagram"></a></p>

<p><strong>Peculiarities:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Multi-paradigm.</strong> State and Tree are fully declarative. Event is imperative. Behavior is functional. Some parts are reactive, other parts are passive (e.g. Behavior reacts to State, and Tree is passive to the Behavior).</p>

<p><strong>Behavior.</strong> Not seen in any other architecture in this post, the Behavior separates UI rendering (Tree) from its dynamic properties. These are allegedly different concerns: Tree is comparable to HTML, Behavior is comparable to CSS.</p>

<p><strong>User event handlers are declared separately from rendering.</strong> BEST is one of the few unidirectional architectures that do not attach user event handlers in the rendering. User event handlers belong to Event, not to Tree.</p>

<p>In the context of this architecture, “View” is a Tree, and a “Component” is a Behavior-Event-Tree-State tuple. Components are UI programs. BEST is a fractal architecture.</p>

<h2 id="elm" class="hr"><span class="hr">MODEL-VIEW-UPDATE</span></h2>

<p>Also known as “<a href="https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/">The Elm Architecture</a>”, Model-View-Update shares similarities to Redux, mainly because the latter is inspired by this architecture. This is a purely functional architecture because its host language is <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, a functional programming language for the Web.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Model</strong>: a type defining the structure of state data</li>
  <li><strong>View</strong>: a pure function transforming state into rendering</li>
  <li><strong>Actions</strong>: a type defining user events sent through mailboxes</li>
  <li><strong>Update</strong>: a pure function from previous state and an action to new state</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/img/mvu-unidir-ui-arch.jpg"><img src="/img/mvu-unidir-ui-arch.jpg" alt="Model-View-Update diagram"></a></p>

<p><strong>Peculiarities:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hierarchical composition everywhere.</strong> The previous architectures had hierarchical composition only in their “View”, however in the MVU architecture such composition is also found in Model and Update. Even Actions may contain nested Actions.</p>

<p><strong>Components are exported as pieces.</strong> Because of the hierarchical composition everywhere, a “component” in the Elm Architecture is a tuple of: a Model type, an initial Model instance, a View function, an Action type, and an Update function. There cannot be components which deviate from this structure throughout the whole architecture. Each component is a UI program, and this architecture is fractal.</p>

<h2 id="elm" class="hr"><span class="hr">MODEL-VIEW-INTENT</span></h2>

<p>Introduced as a fully reactive unidirectional architecture based on <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">RxJS</a> Observables, Model-View-Intent is the primary architectural pattern in the framework <a href="http://cycle.js.org">Cycle.js</a>. The <em>Observable</em> event stream is a primitive used everywhere, and functions over Observables are pieces of the architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intent</strong>: function from Observable of user events to Observable of “actions”</li>
  <li><strong>Model</strong>: function from Observable of actions to Observable of state</li>
  <li><strong>View</strong>: function from Observable of state to Observable of rendering</li>
  <li><strong>Custom element</strong>: subsection of the rendering which is in itself a UI program. May be implemented as MVI, or as a Web Component. Is optional to use in a View.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/img/mvi-unidir-ui-arch.jpg"><img src="/img/mvi-unidir-ui-arch.jpg" alt="Model-View-Intent diagram"></a></p>

<p><strong>Peculiarities:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Heavily based on Observables.</strong> The outcome of each part of the architecture is expressed as an Observable event stream. Because of this, it is hard or impossible to express any “data flow” or “change” without using Observables.</p>

<p><strong>Intent.</strong> Roughly comparable to <em>Event</em> in BEST, user event handlers are declared in the Intent, separately from rendering. Unlike BEST, Intent produces Observable streams of actions, which are like those in Flux, Redux, and Elm. Unlike Flux and others, though, actions in MVI are not directly sent to a Dispatcher or a Store. They are simply available for the Model to listen.</p>

<p><strong>Fully reactive.</strong> The user’s rendering reacts to the View’s output, which reacts to the Model’s output, which reacts to the Intent’s output (actions), which reacts to user events.</p>

<p>A MVI tuple is a UI program. This architecture is fractal if and only if all custom elements are implemented with MVI.</p>

<h2 id="nested-dialogues" class="hr"><span class="hr">NESTED DIALOGUES</span></h2>

<p>This blog post introduces <em>Nested Dialogues</em> as a new unidirectional architecture meant for Cycle.js and any other approach based solely on Observables. It is an evolution of the Model-View-Intent architecture.</p>

<p>Start from the fact that a Model-View-Intent sequence can be functionally composed as a single function, a “Dialogue”:</p>

<p><a href="/img/dialogue-mvi-unidir-ui-arch.jpg"><img src="/img/dialogue-mvi-unidir-ui-arch.jpg" alt="A Dialogue function equivalent to Model-View-Intent"></a></p>

<p>As the diagram suggests, a <strong>Dialogue</strong> is a function taking an Observable of user events as input (the input of Intent) and outputting an Observable of renderings (the output of View). Therefore a Dialogue is a UI program.</p>

<p>We generalize the definition of a Dialogue to allow other targets beyond the user, with an input Observable and an output Observable for each target. For example, if a Dialogue interfaces with a user and a server over HTTP, the Dialogue would take two Observables as input: Observable of user events and Observable of HTTP responses. Then, it would output two Observables as output: Observable of renderings and Observable of HTTP requests. This is the concept of <a href="http://cycle.js.org/drivers.html">Drivers</a> in Cycle.js.</p>

<p>This is how Model-View-Intent restructured as a Dialogue looks like:</p>

<p><a href="/img/single-dialogue-unidir-ui-arch.jpg"><img src="/img/single-dialogue-unidir-ui-arch.jpg" alt="A Dialogue function as a UI program"></a></p>

<p>To reuse a Dialogue function as a subcomponent UI program in a larger program is a matter of nesting a Dialogue inside another one:</p>

<p><a href="/img/nested-dialogues-unidir-ui-arch.jpg"><img src="/img/nested-dialogues-unidir-ui-arch.jpg" alt="Nested Dialogues"></a></p>

<p>The wiring of Observables between layers of Dialogues is a data flow graph. It is not necessarily an acyclic graph. There are cases such as dynamic lists of subcomponents where a cycle is needed in the data flow graph. Examples of such are beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>

<p>Nested Dialogues is in fact a meta-architecture: it has no convention for the internal structure of a component, allowing us to embed any of the aforementioned architectures into a Nested Dialogue component. The only convention regards the interface of a Dialogue’s extremes: input must be a (collection of) Observable(s), output also must be a (collection of) Observable(s). If a UI program structured as Flux or Model-View-Update or others can have its output and inputs expressed as Observables, then that UI program can be embedded into a Nested Dialogues program as a Dialogue function.</p>

<p>This architecture is therefore fractal (with regards to the Dialogue interface only) and general.</p>

<p>See this <a href="https://github.com/cyclejs/todomvc-cycle">TodoMVC implementation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cyclejs/cycle-examples/tree/master/bmi-nested">this small app</a> as examples of Nested Dialogues with Cycle.js.</p>

<h2 id="elm" class="hr"><span class="hr">MY BIASED CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>While the generality and elegance of Nested Dialogues can be theoretically used to embed other architectures as subcomponents, I am mainly interested in this architecture for structuring Cycle.js applications. I have been searching for a UI architecture which feels <strong>natural</strong> and <strong>flexible</strong>, while at the same providing <strong>structure</strong>.</p>

<p>I believe Nested Dialogues is <em>natural</em> because it directly represents what any typical UI program does: an ongoing process (Observables are ongoing processes) that takes user events as input (the input Observable), and produces rendering as output (the output Observable).</p>

<p>It should be a <em>flexible</em> architecture as well, because as we saw, the internal structure of a Dialogue can be freely implemented with any pattern. This is in contrast to Model-View-Update which has a rigid structure as convention. Fractal architectures seem more reusable than non-fractals, so I’m glad Nested Dialogues has this property too.</p>

<p>However, some common <em>structure</em> can be helpful to guide development. While I believe the internal structure of a Dialogue could be Flux, I think Model-View-Intent fits the Observable input/output interface naturally. So while I want to be free to not implement a Dialogue as MVI, I acknowledge most of the times I will structure it as MVI.</p>

<p>I don’t want to be pretentious to say this is the best user interface architecture, because I have just discovered it and still need to use it in the wild to see its pros and cons. Nested Dialogues is just my strongest bet at the moment.</p>

            <h1>Type on Screen</h1>
            <p>by ARAL BALKAN</p>
            <p>One of the iconic representations of the digital age is an image of the ubiquitous digital screen, stereotypically represented as a grid of brightly-lit pixels.</p>
            <p>This, like many of our other traditional perceptions of digital and interactive experiences, are either changing or being replaced altogether as we enter the post-PC era. New devices have such high resolution displays that individual pixels become imperceptibly small. Other devices, like the Amazon Kindle, eschew pixels altogether — opting to use electronic ink.<br></p>
            <p>These new devices are radically transforming what is possible in digital visual design and this has radical implications for digital typography.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The death of the pixel leaves you with a flowing, magazine-quality canvas to design for. A canvas where curves are curves, not ugly pixel approximations of curves. A canvas that begins to blur the line between what we consider to be real and what we consider to be virtual.</p>
            <p>It wasn't too long ago that there was one set of rules for use of type on print and use of type on screen. Now that we have screens that are essentially print quality, we have to reevaluate these conventions.</p>
            <p> Web sites are transforming from boring fields of Arial to embrace the gamut of typographical possibilities offered by web fonts. Web fonts, combined with the style and layout options presented by the creative use of CSS and JavaScript offer a new world of typographic opportunity on the web.&nbsp;</p><h2>Emotional Typography</h2>
            <p>Web fonts allow for a wider palette of typefaces which can provide far more quirkiness and personality.</p>
            <p>The challenge is to help people understand this. The classics such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana or Tahoma are engrained as fonts you will always expect to see; readers aren't used to seeing type choices beyond these usual suspects.</p>
            <p>The majority of screen graphics are done with JPGs that don't scale from the regular screens to retina screens. Now if you have these new type choices as web fonts, you have a scalable version of this which you can use, providing endless possibilities.</p><h2>Technical Advantages</h2>
            <p>Think of this as adapting your tone of voice to the type of person or situation you are in. If you were being given a medical diagnosis the tone would not be fun or light-hearted. In contrast talking colloquially to a close friend could be the opposite of this.</p>
            <p>Web fonts allow you to have this kind of razor-sharp efficiency and elegance in design whilst at the same time avoiding the need for adding additional page graphics, which in turn add load time, decrease workflow performance and risk breaking across screen dimensions and device situations.</p>
